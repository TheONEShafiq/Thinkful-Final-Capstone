# Thinkful-Final-Capstone
Final Capstone to become a Data Scientist

For this Capstone, you will build a model. Extending on the work you pursued in your specialization, go out and build a model.
However, this cannot just be any model. It has to be something we would classify as a "Data Science Product". What do we mean by that?

A data science product is more than just a model. It is a solution. Your final capstone should solve a real problem and create something of value. A product that you would argue to implement in production and/or launch.

Deliverables:

 - A one page proposal to be approved by the data science team here, before you begin
 - A jupyter notebook that builds the model and shows your machine learning tuning process
 - A 20 Minute Presentation on your product that argues not only for its relevance, but why this implementation is best, and the technical tools you will use to get there. This presentation should include a demo!
 
Final Project Proposal:

The Problem: At my company, we have developed 'smart devices' for our industry. While we continue to evolve the solution, the existing first generation of devices created the unintended consequence of having to audit the data before passing these audited records along to our DWH for consumption. This is akin the 'master data management'. Currently this is being performed by a human being and they are having to review all the records and either approve (A), reject (R) or change (C) a record. This review process takes hours per day as the number of records increases with each new device we install. I want to automate this process using data science tools.

How is my solution valuable: It will free up valuable time for a person to spend on solving customer issues as opposed to cleaning data.

What is my data source and how will I access it: My data source comes from the application that we are currently using to perform the audit function. I can access teh data source via SQL connection.

What techniques from the course do you anticipate using? I anticipate using EDA techniques, supervised learning techniques for building the model(s) and evaluation of those models. There may an a opportunity for use of NLP as some of the data is unstructured and could possibly be used to enhance the model's predictiveness.

What do you anticipate to be the biggest challenge youâ€™ll face? The biggest challenge will be on feature creation, balancing the data and playing with the parameters to improve the model's performance.
